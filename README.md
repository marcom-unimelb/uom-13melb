UoM 13MELB contacts directory
==========

### Overview
13MELB contact centre is currently relying on an Excel
spreadsheet for storing and lookup of University contacts information.
This solution makes searching, annotating, modifying and scaling cumbersome and unintuative.

In order to address this issue, the contacts directory is being transitioned into a web application
to be accessed by staff via their browser.

### Features
- intelligent search and results refinement functionalities
- annotations and commenting capability
- version control of records changes
